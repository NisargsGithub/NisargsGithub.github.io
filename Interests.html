		<p>Some interests that I have are video games, hiking, intellectual discussions, politics, and food. I like to see how intelligent people are as well as try out new restaurants with various food options, especially since I'm more vegan than vegetarian at this point. I like many old tv shows and cartoons as well as many Youtube videos of memes and new music that I'm into. The type of music I'm into can be described as trance, electronica, and techno. I feel like this kind of music is truly freeing since it doesn't require words too often but really mostly your feelings. As someone who is very cerebral, I'm into astrology and even the MBTI to get a better understanding of people.
