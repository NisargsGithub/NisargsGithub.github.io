		<p> Goals that I have in my life are to get a better job once I've secured my Cybersecurity degree through Wake Tech, overcoming my depression so that I have a better social life, becoming a better cook so that I feel healthier and better about myself and my life, and earning more money so that things are easier to afford, like clothes and travel. I would love to travel the world, especially visiting Hawaii someday.
