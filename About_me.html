		<p>A couple things about me. I'm a fairly quiet person who doesn't socialize too much. I'm indian born in India. I was only there for a couple of years. After that, I came to the states. I lived in Florida for a good portion of my life going to grade school and college there until November 2011. During that same month, I moved to North Carolina and have lived here since. I managed to get my my own place eventually and I currently work at Duke as a courier. I'm currently back to school for Cybersecurity.</p>
